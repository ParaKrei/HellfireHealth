# LICENSE
This repository (including the code, assets, and raw asset files), falls under the "Sonic Robo Blast 2" message board's "Open Assets" license.

If you want to use ANYTHING in this repo, or make any forks/derivatives, you MUST follow the rules.
## A basic summary
If you use any assets from this online repository on GitHub, then you must credit the author, and provide a link to the original mod in your own mod's description.

It is important to credit the original work(s) so others can discover where the original assets come from.

If you make a derivative or fork (which can either be a modified version or a direct continuation), you MUST put your version under the same license.

If you fail to do so, your fork will be either rejected, or forcefully marked as "Open Assets" on the official SRB2 Message Board.

While there might not be much moderation outside of the message board, I (the author) will personally take action if needed.

This modification is ulimately a fan-work, and therefore is designed to be a non-profit, and passionate creation for the "Sonic Robo Blast 2" fan game.
